I assume that DOS 2.5 and 2.6 were the most common versions in 8050 and 8250 drives.  However, I cannot find a good source for a disassembly of these ROMS.

The disassembly in this directory is from DOS 2.7.

The ROMs themselves can be found at:

 There is a fully documented disassembly of an 8250 DOS ROM available but it is in German, and a set of PNG files:
