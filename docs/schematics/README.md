There are some minor differences between early (mostly/entirely 2040?) digital PCBs and later ones such as the 3040 and 4040:

- UA1 is not populated on the 2040.  It appears to have been installed on later boards to clean up some of the clock signals.  See
    - pin 39 of the 6502 (UN1)
    - pin 28 of the 6504 (UH3)
